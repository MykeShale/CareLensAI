# Data Sources for AI-Powered Health Monitoring System

This document provides information about the data sources used in the AI-Powered Health Monitoring System project. It includes details on how to access and utilize the datasets for health monitoring and analysis.

## Data Sources

1. **Wearable Device APIs**
   - Data can be collected from various wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers. APIs from devices like Fitbit and Apple Health can be utilized to gather real-time health metrics including heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and activity levels.

2. **Simulated Data**
   - For initial testing and development, simulated health data can be generated using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. This allows for the creation of datasets that mimic real-world health metrics.

3. **Publicly Available Health Datasets**
   - The project may also utilize publicly available health datasets, such as those from the PhysioNet Database. These datasets can provide historical health data for analysis and model training.

## Accessing the Data

- **Wearable Device APIs**: Refer to the respective API documentation for authentication and data retrieval methods.
- **Simulated Data**: Use the provided Python scripts in the `src` directory to generate and manipulate simulated health data.
- **Public Datasets**: Access the PhysioNet Database at [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/) and follow the instructions for downloading and using the datasets.

## Utilizing the Data

- Data collected from wearable devices or simulated sources should be preprocessed using the functions defined in `src/preprocessing.py` to ensure it is clean and normalized for analysis.
- Anomaly detection algorithms implemented in `src/anomaly_detection.py` can be applied to the processed data to identify any abnormal health conditions.
- The results can then be used to generate personalized health recommendations through the functions in `src/recommendations.py`.

For further details on the data processing and analysis workflow, please refer to the documentation in the `docs` directory.
