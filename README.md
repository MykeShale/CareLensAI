# AI-Powered Health Monitoring System

## Project Overview
The AI-Powered Health Monitoring System is designed to monitor users' health in real-time by leveraging data from wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers. The system analyzes key health metrics including heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and activity levels to detect anomalies and provide personalized health recommendations.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Health Monitoring**: Collect and analyze data from wearable devices.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Utilize AI to identify abnormal health conditions.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Offer actionable health advice based on user data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Access health data and recommendations through a mobile or web app.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains data sources and information on how to access and utilize datasets.
- **docs/**: Includes detailed project reports covering objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
- **models/**: Outlines the machine learning models used, including algorithm descriptions and implementations.
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualizations.
- **src/**: The main source code for the project, including data collection, preprocessing, anomaly detection, recommendations, and evaluation.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for various components of the system to ensure functionality.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
- **Dockerfile**: Instructions for building a Docker image for deployment.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
