## Visualizations and Screenshots

To enhance the clarity and usability of the AI-Powered Health Monitoring System report, several visual elements have been incorporated. These visuals not only illustrate the system’s functionality but also provide evidence of model performance and user experience.

### 2.1 User Interface Screenshots
- **Dashboard View**: Displays real-time health metrics including heart rate, blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂), and activity level.
- **Anomaly Alert Screen**: Shows a warning message when abnormal patterns are detected, such as sustained elevated heart rate or oxygen desaturation.
- **Recommendation Panel**: Presents personalized health tips, for example: “Increase your daily hydration to maintain optimal blood pressure.”

### 2.2 Example Outputs
- **Anomaly Detection Output**: Visual representation of the anomaly classification, indicating severity and suggested next steps.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-generated health advice based on recent activity and biometric trends.

### 2.3 Model Performance Visuals
- **Accuracy and F1-Score Graphs**: Charts showing the model’s performance across training and test datasets.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A heatmap visualizing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for anomaly detection.

### 2.4 System Architecture Diagram
A schematic diagram outlining the system’s data flow:
1. Data captured from wearable devices.
2. Secure transmission to the backend.
3. AI-based anomaly detection and recommendation generation.
4. Display of results in the web or mobile interface.

These visuals collectively serve to bridge the gap between the technical implementation and the end-user experience, ensuring stakeholders can understand both the underlying mechanisms and the practical outcomes.
