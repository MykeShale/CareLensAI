# Machine Learning Models in AI-Powered Health Monitoring System

This README file provides an overview of the machine learning models used in the AI-Powered Health Monitoring System project. 

## Overview

The project employs various machine learning algorithms to analyze health metrics collected from wearable devices. The primary objectives of these models are to detect anomalies in health data and provide personalized health recommendations.

## Models Used

1. **Anomaly Detection Models**
   - **Isolation Forest**: This model is used to identify abnormal health conditions by analyzing features such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels. It works by isolating observations in the dataset, where anomalies are expected to be isolated faster than normal observations.

2. **Recommendation Models**
   - **Random Forest**: This model is utilized for classification tasks, such as distinguishing between normal and abnormal health states based on historical data.
   - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: This deep learning model is applied to predict future health trends based on time-series data, allowing for more accurate forecasting of health metrics.

## Implementation Details

- The models are implemented using popular libraries such as Scikit-learn for traditional machine learning algorithms and TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning models.
- Data preprocessing steps are crucial for ensuring the models receive clean and normalized data for training and evaluation.

## Future Work

- Continuous improvement of model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and the incorporation of additional data sources.
- Exploration of other machine learning algorithms to enhance the system's predictive capabilities.

## Conclusion

The machine learning models implemented in this project play a vital role in monitoring health metrics and providing actionable insights to users. Further enhancements and evaluations will contribute to the system's effectiveness and reliability.
